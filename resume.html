<h1 class="mb-4">Web Developer</h1>

Web Developer with 5 years of experience in creating 100+ landing pages and
promotional banners, including porting them to various
international sites in a multitude of languages. I worked on a team creating 20+ new sites, taking them from
Ideation to final
implementation. I coded multiple modules and templates, and also took part in updating outdated sites to new
modern scalable
frameworks. I worked hand in hand with Art Directors and Project Managers to accomplish the above in a
timely manner that would help
generate lead and bring in new clients, accomplishing the mission of our team.
